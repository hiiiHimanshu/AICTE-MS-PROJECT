Model Training
As the prediction is a classification problem so the models we will be using are :

LogisticRegression :  It predicts that the probability of a given data belongs to the particular category or not.
XGBClassifier : It refers to Gradient Boosted decision trees. In this algorithm, decision trees are created in sequential form and weights are assigned to all the independent variables which are then fed into the decision tree which predicts results.
SVC : SVC is used to find a hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that distinctly classifies the data points. Then it gives the output according the most nearby element.
RandomForestClassifier : Random forest classifier creates a set of decision trees from a randomly selected subset of the training set. Then, it collects the votes from different decision trees to decide the final prediction.

This project focuses on building a **machine learning-based fraud detection system** for online payments. It uses classification algorithms to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate, based on historical transaction data.

## üìñ About the Project

Online payment fraud is a major issue in digital transactions. This project leverages machine learning models to accurately detect and classify fraudulent transactions in real-time.

**Objectives:**
- Explore and preprocess the dataset.
- Apply multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.).
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualize key results.

---

## üìÇ Dataset

We used a **publicly available dataset** that includes thousands of online transaction records with features like transaction type, amount, old balance, new balance, etc.

- Source: [Kaggle or other dataset link]
- Features include:
  - `step`, `type`, `amount`, `oldbalanceOrg`, `newbalanceOrig`, etc.
  - Target: `isFraud` (0 = legitimate, 1 = fraud)

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- GOOGLE COLLAB Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
